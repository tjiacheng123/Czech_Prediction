# Loan Prediction using Python
We will be utilizing datasets from PKDD'99 Discovery Challenge. The datasets are real anonymized transactions from a Czech bank. The goal is to build a prediction model to predict loan taken up which will involve multiple datasets such as loan, customer, transaction and demographic details. 

We will be utilizing Python, SQL and Jupyter notebook environment to perform our exploratory data analysis and to build our prediction model.

More information and files on the datasets can be found in this [link](https://data.world/lpetrocelli/czech-financial-dataset-real-anonymized-transactions).

<br/>
The data transformation and exploration process includes:
- Joining multiple datasets
- Date parsing
- Utilizing SQL to join datasets based on multiple criterias (less than criteria)
- Peform group by
- Creating functions
- Rename/Reorder column headers
- Filtering required rows
- Created charts (countplot, boxplot, jointplot & histograms)
