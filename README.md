# Loan Prediction
We will be utilizing datasets from PKDD'99 Discovery Challenge. The datasets are real anonymized transactions from a Czech bank. The goal is to build a prediction model to predict loan taken up which will involve multiple datasets such as loan, customer, transaction and demographic details. 

We will be utilizing Python and Jupyter notebook environment to peform our exploratory data analysis and to build our prediction model.

More information and files on the datasets can be found in this [link](https://data.world/lpetrocelli/czech-financial-dataset-real-anonymized-transactions)

Currently building the prediction model and will be uploading my script in the coming weeks :)
