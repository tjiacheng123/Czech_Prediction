# Loan Prediction
We will be utilizing datasets from PKDD'99 Discovery Challenge. The datasets are real anonymized transactions from a Czech bank and hence, results interpreted will be more meaningful and accurate. The goal is to build a prediction model to predict loan taken up which will involve many datasets such as loan, customer details and demographic details. 

We will be utilizing Python and Jupyter notebook to peform our exploratory data analysis and build our prediction model.
