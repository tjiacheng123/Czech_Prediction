# Loan Prediction
We will be utilizing datasets from PKDD'99 Discovery Challenge. The datasets are real anonymized transactions from a Czech bank and hence, results interpreted will be more meaningful and accurate. The goal is to build a prediciton model to predict loan taken up which will involve many datasets such as loan, customer details and demographic details.  

The data can be downloaded here from this [link](https://data.world/lpetrocelli/czech-financial-dataset-real-anonymized-transactions)
